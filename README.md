# Drone Control with Natural Language Commands

## Overview
This project demonstrates a natural language-driven control of a Tello drone using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system interprets natural language commands, converts them into drone actions, and executes them in sequence. The commands are processed using OpenAI's LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate specific drone actions like takeoff, landing, hovering, and directional movements.


## Dependencies

### Required Libraries
1. **Python 3.10** or above
2. **`djitellopy`** - A library to interface with the DJI Tello drone.
   ```bash
   pip install djitellopy
   ```
3. **OpenAI API Client Library**  
   Install OpenAI's API client library:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```
4. ** Transfomer Library ** 
Install the `transformers` library for Vision-Language Model (VLM) support, e.g., BLIP:
```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Running the Scripts

### Clone the Repository
1. To start, clone this repository into your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imsafwan/Drone-control-with-LLM.git
```

## Demo Scripts

## Demo Scripts

### 1. Demo 1: Basic Drone Control with Textual Instructions
In Demo 1, the LLM interprets textual instructions by breaking them down into smaller, executable actions based on the droneâ€™s skill set. These actions are then mapped to lower-level control functions using the `djitellopy` API.

To run Demo 1:
```bash
cd Scripts
python gpt_tello.py
```

### 2. Demo 2: Drone Control with Object Identification
Demo 2 expands on Demo 1 by adding object detection capabilities. After receiving instructions, the LLM directs the drone to scan its surroundings and take images. These images are then sent to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate captions. The LLM checks if the target object appears in the captions, and if so, the drone captures a photo of it.

To run Demo 2:
1. Ensure transformers (for the BLIP model) is installed.

2. Run main script
```bash
cd Scripts
python gpt_tello_v2.py
```
